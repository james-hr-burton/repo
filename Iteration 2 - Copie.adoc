=== *Project description*
In this project, the concept of the Assited Board will be implemented. The latter represents a game board as well as an interactive tablet for each player. 

For this project, we will make maximum use of existing libraries and good practices.
Development in iterations.

=== *Description for iteration #2 - Project leader: James BURTON*

+++<u>Task: Creation of Clock Class</u>+++ +
Create a diagram for manging the clock will be useful for both chess and checkers, the aim is to measure how long a game takes from start to finish and also to add a time constraint. +
 +
First, a player sets a time limit that he must respect (10 minutes for each player, for example), with idleness included. +
 +
Then, if a player gets disconnected from the game, he has 1 min to reconnect or he will automatically lose the game. +
 +
This tries to solve the problems of long games and player idleness (this prevents an opponent from waiting too long). +
 +
We will be using two types of diagrams, a class diagram and sequence diagram. +

+
+++<u>Task: Improvement of generalization</u>+++ +
Goals: +
1. Have 2 interfaces: *Move* and *Board* with implementations for both (for chess and checkers) +
2. Replace list with multiplicity +
3. To first focus on improving the chess game (for the next iteration), and later on see the checkers game +
 +
This task solves the following problem: our application will be able to manage multiple types of games (at least two, chess and checkers). Because these game are different, each needs specific classes. +

+
+++<u>Task: Possible moves during a game of checkers and chess</u>+++ +
*[POSSIBLE MOVES OR MOVES MADE DURING THE GAME??]* +
Goal: Create a class containing all possible moves +
+
What we will do: +
1. Create a parent class diagram containing all moves that are common to both chess and checkers +
2. Create a child class containing all possible moves for a checkers game +
3. Create a child class containing all possible moves for a chess game +
